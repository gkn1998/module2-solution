        		Beef is a type of meat that comes from cows. There are different types of beef. Beef is popular in the United States.Ground beef is a ground meat made of beef. it is used in many recipes including hamburgers and cottage pie. Steak is a slice off a larger piece of meat, usually beef. In North America, steaks are usually grilled. They are also often pan-fried or broiled. The most tender (softest) cuts of the animal are usually used for steak. This also means that steaks have a high price. The pieces of meat used for steaks are usually cut across the muscle fiber, not along it. This makes them appear more tender. Often, steaks are served with a special sauce called "steak sauce", but sometimes steaks are served with a spicy sauce called horseradish.
